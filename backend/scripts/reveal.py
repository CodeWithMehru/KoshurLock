"""Stage-5 headless verification of 'The Turn'.

Runs the full before/after sequence against the live graph:

    ask(CENTRAL_QUESTION)          -> BEFORE  (should implicate rsharma)
    teach(DEFAULT_CORRECTION)      -> add the confirmed phishing/attacker fact
    forget(anonymous_tip.txt)      -> drop the planted tip
    ask(CENTRAL_QUESTION)          -> AFTER   (should exonerate Rahul Sharma and
                                              name the external attacker / 41.220.13.7)

Gate: the AFTER answer must mention the external attacker or 41.220.13.7 and must
exonerate Rahul Sharma; the two answers must differ.

Run inside the backend container:
    docker compose exec backend python scripts/reveal.py
